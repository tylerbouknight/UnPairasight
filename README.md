## TODO List

We have big plans for unPairasight, and your contributions can accelerate its evolution. Here's a glimpse of the roadmap:

### Minor Changes

- **Notification Preferences**: Add an option for users to toggle on/off notices for encryption completion and file count milestones. This would allow for a personalized balance between automation and user awareness.

- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Make modals and user interfaces more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.
    
- **Password Security**: Elevate password requirements with character count, special characters, and a match/confirm mechanism.
    
- **Undo Trap**: Address the Ctrl+Z loophole that allows users to revert encrypted text in an open file.
    
- **Panic Button**: Add a quick "Encrypt Now" button to the Obsidian ribbon bar for immediate vault encryption.

### Major Changes

- **Encryption Flexibility**: Allow users to select from multiple encryption algorithms, making the plugin adaptable to specific security needs.
    
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Investigate the feasibility of integrating 2FA as an additional layer of security.
    
- **Timed Auto-Lock**: Implement a feature to automatically lock the vault after a user-defined period of inactivity.
    
- **Selective Decryption**: Add the capability to decrypt specific files or folders within the vault, based on user-defined criteria.
    
- **Backup and Restore**: Develop a system for users to conveniently back up and restore their encrypted vaults.
    
- **Audit Logs**: Introduce logging to monitor encryption and decryption activities, useful for both troubleshooting and security assessments.
    
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Ensure unPairasight works seamlessly with other popular Obsidian plugins.

## Caveats & Limitations

- **Password Peril**: Lose your password and you'll lose your dataâ€”no recovery.
    
- **Algorithm Monogamy**: AES-256-CBC is our only flavor. Love it or leave it.
    
- **Blind Decryption**: We don't validate file integrity before decryption. Proceed at your own risk.
    
- **Selective Operations**: As of now, no batch processing based on folders or other tags.
    
- **Audit-Free Zone**: No logs to retrace your encryption steps or omissions.
