# unPairasight: Advanced Vault Encryption for Obsidian

unPairasight supercharges Obsidian's native security capabilities. With features like tag-based file management and AES-256-CBC encryption, unPairasight fills the security gaps in your Obsidian workflow.

**IMPORTANT**: Please, for my sake, backup your vault before using! Tested only on Windows and iOS.

## Key Features

- **AES-256-CBC Encryption**: Secure your files with industry-standard encryption.
    
- **Tag-Managed File Selection**: Encrypt or bypass files based on their tags.
    
- **Auto-Encrypt**: Desktop users enjoy the luxury of auto-encryption upon app closure.
  - Beta 1 release implements URI scheme to trigger vault encryption using obsidian://unpairasight#encrypt. This means that for iOS, you can use Shortcuts to set an automation when obsidian closes, to run the URI and "auto" encrypt the vault.

## Caveats & Limitations

- **Password Peril**: Lose your password and you'll lose your dataâ€”no recovery.
    
- **Algorithm Monogamy**: AES-256-CBC is our only flavor. Love it or leave it.
    
- **Blind Decryption**: We don't validate file integrity before decryption. Proceed at your own risk.
    
- **Selective Operations**: As of now, no batch processing based on folders or other tags.
    
- **Audit-Free Zone**: No logs to retrace your encryption steps or omissions.
